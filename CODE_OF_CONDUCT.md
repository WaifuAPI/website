# Code of Conduct

## Our Commitment

In our pursuit of nurturing an open and inclusive community, we, as contributors and maintainers, vow to ensure that participation in our project is a harassment-free experience for all, regardless of age, physical attributes, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Expectations

Behaviors that promote a positive environment encompass:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language.
- Respecting differing viewpoints and experiences.
- Graciously embracing constructive criticism.
- Prioritizing the well-being of the community.
- Displaying empathy towards fellow community members.

Unacceptable conduct includes:

- Using sexualized language, imagery, or unwelcome advances.
- Engaging in trolling, insulting comments, or personal and political attacks.
- Harassing individuals publicly or privately.
- Sharing others' private information without explicit consent.
- Exhibiting any behavior that would be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Our Obligations

Project maintainers are responsible for defining acceptable behavior standards and are expected to take fair and appropriate corrective actions in response to any unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the authority and responsibility to edit, remove, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions that do not adhere to this Code of Conduct. They may also temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviors deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces and when an individual represents the project or its community in public spaces. Representing the project includes using an official project email address, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as an appointed representative at online or offline events. Project maintainers may further define and clarify what constitutes representation.

## Enforcement

All complaints will be reviewed, investigated, and receive a necessary and appropriate response. The project team is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of the reporter.
